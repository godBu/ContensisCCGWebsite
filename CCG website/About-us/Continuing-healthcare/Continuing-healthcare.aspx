<h2>What is NHS continuing healthcare?</h2>
<p>This is the name given to a package of care which is arranged and funded solely by the NHS for people who have ongoing healthcare needs, but are outside of hospital care.</p>
<p>You can receive NHS continuing healthcare in any setting &ndash; including your own home or in any care home. In your own home, this means that the NHS will pay for healthcare and personal care support, for example, help with bathing and dressing. In a care home, the NHS pays for your fees &ndash; including board and accommodation.</p>
<h2>Who are your NHS continuing healthcare contacts?</h2>
<p>In Trafford, the Personalised Care Department are responsible for supporting people through the continuing healthcare process. The Department consists of Nurses and Administrators who work with Health and Social Care professional to develop a full understanding of people&rsquo;s individual needs.</p>

The Personalised Care Department aim to provide a helpful, transparent, supportive and cost effective service to ensure all involved are clear on the requirements for continuing healthcare.</p>

<h2>Who is eligible for NHS continuing healthcare?</h2>
<p>Anyone assessed as having a certain level of needs may receive continuing healthcare. It is not dependent on a particular disease, diagnosis or condition; or on who provides the care or where that care is provided.</p>
<p>If your overall care needs show that your <strong>primary</strong> need is a health need you should be eligible for NHS continuing healthcare.&nbsp; Once eligible for NHS continuing healthcare, your care will be funded by the NHS; but this is subject to review. Should your care needs change, then the funding arrangements may also change.</p>
<h2>What if I&rsquo;m not eligible for NHS continuing care?</h2>
<p>If you are not eligible, the local authority will discuss with you whether you are eligible for support from them instead. If you are not eligible for NHS continuing healthcare, but still have health needs, the NHS may still pay for part of the package of support. This is sometimes known as a &lsquo;joint package of care&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Whether or not you are eligible for NHS continuing healthcare, you will still be able to make full use of all the other NHS services in Trafford.</p>
<h2>What if I need financial support for care during the end of my life?</h2>
<p>You may be eligible to access the fast track process which enables the Personalised Care Team to fund and organize services to support you. Please contact your health professional in hospital, hospice or the community for more information.</p>
