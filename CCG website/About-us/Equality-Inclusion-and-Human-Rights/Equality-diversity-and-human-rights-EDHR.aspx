<h2>Equality, inclusion and human rights</h2>
<p>The CCG, with the council, has been working on an Equality and Inclusion Strategy 20-24 which was&nbsp; to be published earlier in the year.&nbsp; Unfortunately the two organisations, with the rest of the country, went into a response to the&nbsp; COVID Emergency and the completing of the strategy was put on hold. &nbsp;</p>
<p>However, we have put together a summary of the work's strategic intention for the website.&nbsp; Our work on Equality and Inclusion has carried on and we will now&nbsp; also be revisiting the strategy in the light of the COVID Emergency and the inequalities that have been highlighted.</p>
<p>Therefore, this summary is a place maker for a point in time as we continue the work.</p>

<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NHS Trafford Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) is passionate about Equality and Diversity and this is embedded in our values. We will continue to work with the community and groups across Trafford when we commission services as we aim to meet the health needs of our ever-changing community.</p>
<p>We continue to work in partnership with our providers, voluntary and community sector agencies and other key organisations to ensure that we advance equality of opportunity and meet the requirements of the Equality Act 2010.</p>
<p>The Equality Act 2010 requires us to meet our Public Sector Equality Duty across a range of protected groups, including age, disability, gender, race, sexual orientation, religion or belief, gender identity, marriage or civil partnership status and pregnancy or maternity status.</p>
<p><strong>Section 149 of the Equality Act 2010 requires that public authorities, when exercising their functions, have due regard to the following three aims:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminate discrimination, harassment, victimisation and any other conduct that is prohibited by or under the Act.</li>
<li>Advance equality of opportunity between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not share it.</li>
<li>Foster good relations between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not share it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Protected characteristics &ndash; in the context of Public Sector Equality Duties (PSED) &ndash; are defined as:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Sex / Gender (male / female)</li>
<li>Disability</li>
<li>Gender Reassignment (Transgender)</li>
<li>Race</li>
<li>Religion or Belief</li>
<li>Sexual Orientation</li>
<li>Pregnancy maternity and breastfeeding mums</li>
</ul>
<p>It also applies to marriage and civil partnership, but only in respect of the requirement to have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination. Trafford CCG also considers carers in all its scrutiny for inclusion work.</p>
<p>The Act also sets out a number of specific duties which require the clinical commissioning group to publish annual equality information, comprising of progress against equality objectives and goals, workforce information and the accessible information standard. The clinical commissioning group is working proactively towards meeting its requirements under the Equality Act 2010 and the Public Sector Equality Duty and reporting on its progress in this area.</p>
<h3>Equality Analysis</h3>
<p>The clinical commissioning group has undergone the following equality developments that demonstrate due regard to aims of the Equality Act 2010:</p>
<h4>The adoption of the NHS &lsquo;Equality Delivery System&rsquo;</h4>
<p>The Equality Delivery System process generates evidence of the clinical commissioning group&rsquo;s compliance with the Public Sector Equality Duty and this evidence is then reviewed against our stated goals.</p>
<p>The Equality Delivery System is an assurance mechanism for compliance with the Equality Act 2010 and links with our equality objectives to ensure improvements in patient experience.</p>
<h4>Equality Impact and Risk Assessments embedded in the commissioning process</h4>
<p>Equality Impact and Risk assessments are a primary source for demonstrating how we have considered legal duties under the Human Rights Act 1998, The Equality Act 2010 and the Public Sector Equality Duty.</p>
<p>Assessments evaluate the likely impact in a given scenario on people with a protected characteristic to ensure that employment practices and service commissioning and provision promote equality of opportunity and do not discriminate in any way.</p>
<p>The equality impact and risk assessment process provides an audit trail from inception to decision-making should an organisation be legally challenged or for freedom of information requests.</p>
<p>Whilst the assessments are not a means for ensuring or delivering legal compliance they enable us to capture the considerations made and evidence during key activities such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Policy development and review</li>
<li>Budget planning and allocation</li>
<li>Service planning, review and re design</li>
<li>Projects and work programmes</li>
<li>Commissioning and procurement</li>
</ul>
<p>Clinical commissioning group commissioners have carried out a range of equality analysis and human rights screening when carrying out their duties to ensure the organisation is paying due regard to the three aims of the Public Sector Equality Duty and the Human Rights Act.</p>
<h3>Equality Objectives and Goals</h3>
<p>To help us further meet our requirements under the Equality Act 2010 and our Public Sector Equality Duty, the clinical commissioning group has also identified specific &lsquo;Equality Objectives&rsquo; and &lsquo;Equality Delivery System&rsquo; goals;</p>
<h4>Our Equality Objectives</h4>
<p>To support this, we developed three Equality Objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Objective 1</b>: Improve equality data collection, analysis, and usage to inform commissioning decisions and improve health inequalities for all protected groups.</li>
<li><b>Objective 2</b>: Ensure ongoing effective senior leadership and awareness of equality agenda for Trafford CCG and their membership practices.</li>
<li><b>Objective 3</b>: Ensure patient and public communication and engagement is inclusive of people from all protected groups.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Our Equality Delivery System Goals</h4>
<ul>
<li>Better health outcomes for all</li>
<li>Improved patient access and experience</li>
<li>Empowered, engaged and included staff</li>
<li>Inclusive leadership at all levels</li>
</ul>
