<h2>Do not suffer in silence &ndash; report all hate crimes</h2>
<p>It is important to report all hate incidents, even if you think nothing can be done as it helps the police identify areas of concern and patterns of behaviour. Hate crimes are not only crimes against the targeted victim, but also against a particular group as a whole. It is important to report hate crime to enable the police and other agencies to build a real picture of what is happening in our communities.</p>
<p>For further information see below:</p>

</ul>
<h2>Recognising and reporting any kind of Hate Crime Incident</h2>
<p>Have you been intimidated, harassed, victimised or abused because of who you are or what you believe in?</p>
<p>Hate crime is subjecting people to harassment, victimisation, intimidation or abuse because of their race, faith, religion, disability or because they are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgendered.</p>
<p>Please note that this kind of crime against lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgendered people is known as homophobic / transphobic crime.</p>
<p>The police use the following definition when recording a hate crime:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Any incident, which constitutes a criminal offence, which is perceived by the victim or any other person as being motivated by prejudice or hate.&rdquo;</li>
<li>This refers to any incident, which appears to be related to an individual because of who they are or what they believe in. Such incidents can be devastating to both the victim and an entire community.</li>
<li>All hate crime is important. No hate crime or incident is too minor to report to the police.</li>
<li>Anyone can be the victim of a hate crime. Anyone of us could be targeted because of some aspect of our identity. Tackling hate crime supports each and every one of us.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3rd Party Reporting of Incidents to the police</h2>
<p>If you or your property are not in any immediate danger, however for example, you have seen some transphobic graffiti then you call GMP on 0161 872 5050. The police encourage all our communities to report all hate crime.</p>
<p>Be aware that if you or your property is in danger then you MUST telephone the police straight away on 999. Tell the call taker that you are reporting a hate crime and that you and/or your property is in danger. Hate crime is a high priority crime and someone should contact you as soon as possible.</p>
<h2>Calling</h2>
<p>You can report any form of hate crime anonymously by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or phone the police&rsquo;s non-emergency reporting number on 101.</p>
<p>In an emergency ring 999.</p>
<h2>Why you should report it?</h2>
<p>Reporting a hate crime incident means you help the police to build up patterns of crime and apprehend offenders. Any information you can give to Salford police will help them build up their knowledge to combat hate crime in all its forms.</p>
<h2>True Vision website</h2>
<p>True Vision provides information for victims and the public about what hate crime is, why it is important to report it when it happens, and sets out the range of ways hate crimes can be reported, including via a new online reporting form. The site also provides links to organisations that can offer support and advice on hate crime related issues.</p>
<p>The site includes a secure online reporting facility that allows victims and witnesses to tell the police about hate crimes. The facility automatically distributes reports to the relevant police force.</p>
