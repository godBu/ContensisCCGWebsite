<h2>A Refreshed Equality Delivery System for the NHS</h2>
<p>The Equality Delivery System (EDS) was rolled out to the NHS in July 2011, formally launched in November 2011 and is currently being implemented by the vast majority of NHS organisations across England.</p>
<p>Consultation is underway (October 2014) on the system becoming mandatory for all NHS commissioner and provider organisations.</p>
<p>The design and implementation of the EDS was independently evaluated by Shared Intelligence in 2012 and, based on this evaluation and subsequent engagement with a spread of NHS organisations and stakeholders, a refreshed EDS is now available called EDS2.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the Delivery System is to help local NHS organisations and their partners, in discussion with local stakeholders, review and improve their equality performance for people with characteristics protected by the Equality Act 2010. By using the EDS, NHS organisations can also be helped to deliver on the Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED).</p>
<p>EDS2 is more streamlined and simpler to use than the original and is aligned to NHS England&rsquo;s commitment to an inclusive NHS that is fair and accessible to all.</p>
<p>The Government&rsquo;s Equality Strategy &lsquo;Building a fairer Britain&rsquo; is underpinned by the two principles of equal treatment and equal opportunity.</p>
<p>By eliminating prejudice and discrimination, the NHS can deliver services that are personal, fair and diverse and a society that is healthier and happier. For the NHS, this means making it more accountable to the patients it serves and tackling discrimination in the work place.</p>
<h2>What is the Equality Delivery System?</h2>
<p>The first NHS wide equality performance framework was launched by Sir David Nicholson in November 2011 to all commissioner and provider organisations. It provides a framework to annually measure evidence for 18 required equality outcomes, across four key goals (two for service delivery and two for workforce issues). It should also provide robust evidence of how an organisation is meeting its Public Sector Equality Duties (PSED).</p>
<p>If an NHS organisation does not embed the EDS framework then it needs to clearly evidence an alternative and equivalent framework, in terms of showing how it meets its PSED.</p>
<p>Local interest groups are given training by their NHS to grade this evidence provided by individual NHS organisations. Grading&rsquo;s give an annual public grading in the form of an EDS summary dashboard and 18 case studies detailing the evidence provided focusing on how each of the nine protected groups have been involved in the evidence provided.</p>
<p>Annual public grading&rsquo;s cover performance which is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red: underdeveloped</li>
<li>Amber: developing</li>
<li>Green: achieving</li>
<li>Purple: excelling</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirement to produce evidence of equality outcomes for protected characteristic groups</h2>
<p>EDS and NHS England are urging all NHS organisations to consider how they ensure they can succinctly evidence health equality outcomes which bring in improvements for protected groups.</p>
<p>The <b>Equality Delivery System</b> targets the following performance goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better Health Outcomes for all</li>
<li>Improved patient access &amp; experience</li>
<li>Empowered, engaged &amp; well supported staff</li>
<li>Inclusive leadership at all levels</li>
</ul>
