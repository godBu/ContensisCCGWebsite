<h2>Equality Act 2010</h2>
<p>The Equality Act 2010 came into force on 1 October 2010 and replaced previous anti-discrimination laws with a single Act to more effectively tackle disadvantage and discrimination on the basis of any of the following protected characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Gender (male / female issues)</li>
<li>Gender Reassignment (Transgender issues)</li>
<li>Disability</li>
<li>Race</li>
<li>Sexual orientation (lesbian gay bisexual heterosexual issues)</li>
<li>Religion or belief (including no religion or belief)</li>
<li>Marriage and civil partnership</li>
<li>Pregnancy maternity and breastfeeding mums</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Equality and Human Rights Legislative Framework</h2>
<p>At Trafford CCG we also include carers in all our scrutiny for inclusion work re taking &lsquo;due regard&rsquo; of each of the protected groups in all our planning and decision making processes.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" class="sys_16" href="http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/publication/human-rights-human-lives-guide-human-rights-act-public-authorities">Click here</a> for further guidance on the Equality Act 2010, including Easy Read versions of the guidance.</p>
<h2>Public Sector Equality Duty</h2>
<p>As part of The Equality Act 2010, a new public sector equality duty came into force (which replaced the previous race, gender and disability duties). Its aim is to ensure that public bodies play their part in promoting a fair and more equal society.</p>
<p>The public sector equality duty consists of a general duty, which came into force on 5 April 2011, and specific duties which came into force on 10 September 2011.</p>
<p>The <b>general duty</b> consists of three aims, which require public bodies to have due regard for the need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Eliminate discrimination, harassment and victimisation.</li>
<li>Advance equality of opportunity between people who share a relevant protected characteristic and those who don&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>Foster good relations between people who share a relevant protected characteristic and those who don&rsquo;t.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <b>specific duties</b> require public bodies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish relevant, proportionate information demonstrating compliance with the general duty at least annually, starting 31 January 2012.</li>
<li>Prepare and publish specific, measurable equality objectives at least every four years starting 6 April 2012. (CCGs set Equality Objectives by 13 October 2013 and at least every four years from that date &ndash; Health and Social Care Act 2012 change re CCGs only)</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Health and Social Care Act 2012</h2>
<p>The Health and Social Care Act introduced the first ever statutory duties relating to addressing inequalities in health.</p>
<p>Following the Health and Social Care Act 2012, the EDC (NHS Equality Delivery Council) has introduced new, more inclusive ways of working that will support healthcare services to tackle health inequalities and advance equality and human rights in the new NHS landscape.</p>
<h2>Commissioning to Reduce Health Inequalities</h2>
<p>The Marmot Review, <i>Fair Society Healthy Lives</i>, shows us that health inequalities are widespread in England. There is a pronounced socio-economic gradient in the prevalence of all major long term conditions, in life expectancy and in disability-free life expectancy. Of course, health inequalities result from social inequalities and to reduce health inequalities requires action across the social determinants of health.</p>
<p>However the NHS also has a pivotal contribution to make in reducing health inequalities both in the way it commissions services and in the way it provides health care.</p>
<p>Reducing health inequalities is a major priority for CCGs and Local Authorities for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Health and Social Care Act 2012 places a legal duty on CCGs to tackle health inequalities and they will be assessed annually on performance of this duty.</li>
<li>Taking action to reduce health inequalities will result in substantial population health gains, reduced healthcare spend and improved health outcomes.</li>
