<p>Equality Analysis (EA) is carried out by Trafford CCG on key healthcare changes. The aim is to find out whether there are any adverse impacts on people from local protected groups.</p>
<p>Through feedback and recommendations received, the CCG are able to consider such impacts and consider mitigation where possible. We want to work with local communities of interest to ensure our services provide practical and fair access to information, services premises and employment opportunities.</p>
<p>CCG&rsquo;s are also required to recognise and manage equality business risk. We are looking to find practical solutions which deliver fair and accessible services to all sections of our local communities.</p>
<p>Equality Analysis (EA) is a measure of outcomes to identify the potential impact of an NHS organisation&rsquo;s policies, services, or functions, on those community groups or individuals affected by such changes i.e. its patients, carers and staff.</p>
<p>It can help staff provide and deliver excellent services to patients by making sure that they closely reflect the needs of the community and take due regard of the impacts of key changes around inclusion and fair access to information, services, premise, and employment opportunities.</p>
<p>By carrying out an EA, an NHS organisation may also ensure that the services that it provides fulfils &nbsp;the requirements of anti-discrimination and equalities legislation (such as meeting the Equality Duty) and are therefore legally compliant.</p>
<p>The CCG has an Equality Duty to continue to examine our policies, practices, services and functions to ensure they are fair and do not create adverse impacts or barriers for protected characteristic groups including: age, gender, gender reassignment, disability, race, sexual orientation, religion or belief, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy, maternity and breastfeeding mums.</p>
<p>At Trafford CCG we also include carers in all our scrutiny for inclusion work. We want to go beyond the minimum requirements of equality legislation and evidence how we embed social inclusion into our day to day healthcare practices.</p>
<p>This means that we have to scrutinise what we do, how we do it and the decisions we make by means of EA.</p>
<p>We have reviewed our scrutiny for inclusion process to ensure this continues to be &lsquo;fit for purpose&rsquo;. We will also introduce a rolling programme of EA over the next 12 months to identify potential areas of adverse impact for local protected groups.</p>
<p>EA&rsquo;s are carried out by the CCG (and in some areas by North West Commissioning Support Unit or NW CSU) for commissioned and corporate services. Trafford continues to review our EA process to ensure our focus is on achieving practical outcomes for patients and staff, rather than focusing on the EA process alone.</p>
<p>Equality Analysis provides a structured way of looking at and examining the effects or impact of a proposed or existing policy, practice, service (re) design or function on protected characteristic groups. We can use EA to find out what may be wrong as well as to tell us what is working well. We can find ways of correcting or improving things if needed, by talking, listening to and involving people from across the community and from protected characteristic groups.</p>
<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<ul>
<li>An EA is a snap shot in time showing how inclusive our services are to protected characteristic groups in our local communities.</li>
<li>EAs are a way of the CCG evidencing how it gives &lsquo;due regard&rsquo; to vulnerable people from local protected characteristic groups, in all its planning and decision making process, and from the earliest stages of consideration.</li>
<li>EAs should deliver robust equality outcomes which ultimately drive commissioned services to more closely reflect patient and staff need.</li>
<li>We are currently delivering a targeted training programme for nominated EA Lead staff and are developing a rolling programme of priority EAs for completion.</li>
</ul>
