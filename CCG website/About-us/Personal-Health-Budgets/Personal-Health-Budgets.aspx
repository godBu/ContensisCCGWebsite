<p>A Personal Health Budget (PHB) is an amount of money to support a person&rsquo;s identified health and well-being needs. A PHB application is planned and agreed between the person, their representative or, in the case of children, their families and healthcare professionals. It is not new money; it is money that would normally have been spent by the NHS on the person&rsquo;s care but used more flexibly to meet their identified needs.</p>
<p>If you have a PHB, you will be able to use it for a range of things to help you meet your health and well-being goals. For example, therapies, personal care and equipment. You will have control over your care and can co-ordinate it in a manner which supports your lifestyle and well-being.</p>
<p>All about personal health budgets - <a title="easy-read-phb" class="sys_21" href="/docs/About-us/Personal-Health-Budgets/easy-read-phb.pdf">easy read version</a></p>
<h2>Who is eligible for a Personal Health Budget?</h2>
<p>NHS England guidance states that the people who fall under the following have the <strong>right to have</strong> a PHB, and be offered a direct payment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adults eligible for&nbsp;Continuing Healthcare</li>
<li>Children and young people eligible for&nbsp;Continuing Care</li>
</ul>
<p>Outside of this, each locality was asked to create a wider local offer to allow more patients the opportunity for Personalised Care. In Trafford, this offer currently extends to the above and now includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adults accessing Community Learning Disability Team</li>
<li>Adults accessing Community Mental Health Team</li>
<li>Adults accessing Community Neuro Rehab Team</li>
<li>Adults at end of life</li>
<li>Children and young people accessing Complex Needs Team</li>
<li>Children and young people with Education, Health and Care Plans</li>
<li>Joint funded Health and Social Care.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How do I get a Personal Health Budget?</h2>
<p><b>Step 1: Your health needs assessment </b>The CCG will decide if you are eligible to receive a PHB. If you are eligible, you will need to have a health needs assessment. A health professional can arrange this for you and assess your current level of need.</p>
<p><b>Step 2: Your &lsquo;indicative budget&rsquo; </b>Following your health needs assessment, the nurse/health profession will use the results to work out approximately how much money you will need. This is called an &ldquo;indicative budget&rdquo; Your &ldquo;indicative budget&rdquo; is an estimated amount of money based on how much support the CCG would need to provide to meet your needs. This amount isn&rsquo;t final. The CCG will set the final amount once it has agreed your support plan.</p>
<p><b>Step 3: Your support plan </b>Next you will need to start working on your support plan to identify your health and wellbeing outcomes and say how you will spend your money so that you achieve your goals. You may decide to choose to do things differently than the CCG. For example you may want to employ your own personal assistants.</p>
<p>Your budget could go up or down once your support plan is completed. This will need to be agreed by the CCG.</p>
<h2>Anyone can help you complete your support plan:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Community nurse or clinical case manager</li>
<li>Friends and family</li>
<li>A support broker</li>
</ul>
<p>A list of approved service support brokers <a title="Approved Provider List Brochure" class="sys_21" href="/docs/About-us/Approved-Provider-List-Brochure.pdf">can be found by clicking here.</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The plan must be agreed and signed off by a health professional.</p>
<p><b>Step 4: Receiving the money </b>You can decide to receive your PHB funding in a number of different ways. Support is available to help you manage it, click here for further guidance.</p>
<p><b>Step 5: Arranging your support </b>When your support plan is agreed and you have decided how you will receive your PHB, you will be able to put in place the services you have chosen and get things moving.</p>
<p>The CCG funds any support you may need to set up your services, such as recruitment costs, training for staff, DBS check(s) and any ongoing support you may need to manage your PHB. These costs will be different for everyone and will depend on the services you have chosen.</p>
<p>It can take some time to arrange the care and support you will be purchasing with your PHB. If you need care in the meantime, the CCG will organise this until your PHB is up and running.</p>
<p>If you want to discuss the option of a Personal Health Budget please contact Henry Areo, Admin Officer for PHB / Individualised Care by email: <a class="sys_16" href="mailto:henry.areo@nhs.net">henry.areo@nhs.net</a> or call&nbsp;0161 912 4488.</p>
<p><b>Step 6: Review </b>Your support plan will be reviewed regularly by a health professional to ensure it is meeting your health outcomes. If your needs change or your support is not meeting your needs you will need a reassessment of your needs to ensure the support you are receiving is working well.</p>
