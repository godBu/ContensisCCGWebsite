<p><strong>Gorse Hill Medical Centre and Ayres Road Surgery &ndash; closure of practices</strong></p>
<p>Following an inadequate rating by the Care Quality Commission and the single handed GP partners based at the practices confirming their intention to retire, the CCG engaged with patients and staff regarding how to ensure patients continued to receive a GP service due to the practice closing.</p>
<p>It was vitally important that we were able to effectively communicate with as many patients as possible, as the timescale to plan for the GPs retiring was very limited.&nbsp; In addition to 3 letters being sent out to all patients (with an alternative format sheet included in different languages) and Question and Answer sheet), posters and Q&amp;A sheet were placed in practices and on the practice website and within the local community. We also established a free patient hotline to support patients and capture feedback and respond to any queries. We also used interpreters as required.</p>
<p>As the practices were based in Old Trafford, which has a large south Asian community, we worked with our Publication Reference and Advisory Board, Healthwatch Trafford and community groups to spread the message far and wide.</p>
<p>During the engagement it was apparent that patients were worried regarding how to arrange repeat prescriptions both during the final few weeks at the practice and whilst moving over to the new practice.&nbsp; To support patients and GP practice staff, we arranged for pharmacist staff to be based in the practices to undertake medication reviews and help process prescriptions</p>
<p>Patients were moved over to either Brooks Bar Medical Centre or North Trafford Group practice.</p>
<p><strong>Gloucester House Medical Centre and Old Trafford Medical Practice</strong></p>
<p>Following inadequate ratings by the Care Quality Commission, the GP partner confirmed his intention to retire.&nbsp; The CCG worked with another GP practice to provide caretaking arrangements to ensure that care continued.</p>
<p>Patients were able to access to a free patient hotline and information was promoted in a similar way the Gorse Hill/Old Trafford practice.</p>
<p><strong>Trafford Health Centre </strong></p>
<p>As the contract for Trafford Health Centre with Mastercall was coming to an end we worked to arrange for the transfer of patients to another practice.&nbsp; We followed a similar process to previous gp practice closures, ensuring patients had access to as much information as possible and access to a patient hotline.</p>
<p>All patients were transferred to Flixton Road Medical Centre.</p>
<p>Throughout all the above practice changes, patient choice was still offered to patients and some patients chose to follow this.</p>
