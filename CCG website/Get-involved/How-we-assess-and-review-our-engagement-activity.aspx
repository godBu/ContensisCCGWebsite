<p><strong>Strategic overview&nbsp;</strong>- Our CCG undertakes an internal audit of engagement and is reported to our audit committee. Our Public Reference and Advisory Board are interviewed by the auditor. Any risks relating to engagement are reported in our Board Assurance Framework and reviewed on a regular basis. An annual committee effectiveness review is undertaken for our committees, including Public Reference and Advisory Board.</p>
<p><strong>Local overview</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; We often seek post event feedback following events and workshops. This feedback is used by us to understand how effective the event was in terms of what worked well, what could be improved, how well participants were able to get involved and whether they thought their views were valued.&nbsp; We also seek feedback from our Public Reference and Advisory Board.</p>
<h4><strong>Improving services</strong></h4>
<p>It is important that we constantly improve the health services in the borough.&nbsp; To do this we engage with local patients and residents.</p>
<p>All the health organisations in the borough engage with people to improve their services.&nbsp; We try to work together as much as possible with other partners too and the members involved in Trafford Local Care Alliance and Trafford Partnership make this easier.</p>
<h4><strong>How we hold providers to account on their engagement</strong></h4>
<p>When providers want to make a change to a service, they should let the commissioners know.&nbsp; We then ask about their plans to involve patients in their changes and either get involved as commissioners where that is appropriate, or ask to see the engagement reports before any decisions are made.</p>
<p>Here are some of examples of when that might happen:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Changes to GP practices</strong>. For example in 2019 Barrington Road Medical Centre and St Johns Medical Centre wanted to move into a new health and wellbeing centre. We supported the practices to engage with patients about the proposed change and to gather feedback. Feedback was used by the CCG to consider any possible impact on patients.</li>
<li><strong>Changing how people access a service</strong> &ndash; during late 2018 our providers of phlebotomy services changed from providing drop-in blood tests to bookable appointments. &nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to this, we worked with Healthwatch Trafford to understand patients&rsquo; views regarding phlebotomy services in Trafford. They sought patient views via a survey and community drop-in sessions. Healthwatch provided a report outlining findings to the CCG Governing Body and the providers to help inform any service redesign. Also during the first 4 weeks of the change, we had daily meetings with the provider service managers to review patient feedback about the new service and asked Healthwatch to</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Quality Team is really important in this as they will hear about changes through quality review meetings with providers.&nbsp; We work closely with them to make sure the CCG is asking the right questions, focusing most on those people who will find it hardest to access our services.</p>
<p>Our Patient Experience Matter team is also key. For example in 2019 they worked with a small provider to ensure patients were able to access advocacy closer to Trafford rather than their initial advocacy service which was based close to their headquarters in London.</p>
