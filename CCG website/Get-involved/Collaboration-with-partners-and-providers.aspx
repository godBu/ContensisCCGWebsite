<p>We seek to improve health outcomes and the quality of health services by working inpartnership with others. We have joint commissioning arrangements with Trafford Council and work closely with our acute and community health providers as well as nursing home providers. We also work in partnership with the public health team at Trafford Council to tackle health inequalities and promote healthy lifestyles.</p>
<p>We are active members of Trafford Partnership. The Trafford Partnership is Trafford&rsquo;s Local Strategic Partnership, a single body which brings together organisations including from across the public, private, voluntary, faith and community sectors and local residents.&nbsp; Members of the Trafford Partnership work together to achieve a common vision to ensure&nbsp;Trafford is a place where our residents achieve their aspirations, and our communities are thriving.

<h3><a class="sys_16" href="https://www.gmhsc.org.uk/">Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership</a></h3>
<p>We also work closely with Greater Manchester Health and Care Partnership. The Partnership is made up of local NHS organisations and councils in Greater Manchester (GM), as well as people from NHS England and NHS Improvement, emergency services, the voluntary sector, Healthwatch and others including the mayor of Greater Manchester. &nbsp;As a group, we&rsquo;re finding what works on a local level, and we&rsquo;re responding to what people need across all ten boroughs of GM.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re using our experience and know-how to improve the way we spend our public health money. And we&rsquo;re making sure that big decisions are being made together locally.</p>
<h5>Their aim is:</h5>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&lsquo;To deliver the greatest and fastest possible improvement to the health and wellbeing of the 2.8m people of Greater Manchester&rsquo;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
